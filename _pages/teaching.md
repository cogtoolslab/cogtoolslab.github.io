Here are some courses that Dr. Fan either is currently teaching or has previously taught:

### PSYCH 10: Introduction to Statistics (Stanford)
It is impossible to understand the modern world without an understanding of statistics. From public opinion polls to clinical trials in medicine to online systems that recommend purchases to us, statistics play a role in nearly every aspect of our lives. The goal of this course is to provide an understanding of essential concepts in statistics — how to construct models to explain variation in data — as well as the skills to apply these concepts to real data. [Syllabus](https://psych10.github.io/)

### PSYCH 230: Computational Models of the Creative Process (Stanford)
This advanced seminar will explore computational approaches to understanding the cognitive processes that enable humans to design meaningful experiences for others in a variety of domains, including visual media, musical compositions, written stories, and games. Towards this end, we will discuss contemporary work in the cognitive science, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, education, and artificial intelligence literatures.

### PSYCH 139 / EDUC 139 / DATASCI 194L: Data Science and the Science of Learning (Stanford)
This advanced seminar will explore the application of analytic techniques from modern data science to advance the science of human learning. Students will have opportunities to work with real datasets from educational contexts and engage with contemporary research in the learning sciences, culminating in a final project. This course is intended for advanced undergraduate or graduate students who have already completed prior coursework in introductory statistics and/or data science. 

### PSYCH 267A: Bids for scale in psychological science (Stanford)
Traditional psychological studies have been performed at small scale: with relatively few participants, reporting on relatively restricted sets of conditions, designed to adjudicate a small number of situation-specific hypotheses. However, a confluence of important developments — from the replication crisis, to the advent of online experimental platforms, to the flowering of modern artificial intelligence — has made it increasingly evident that psychological science can (and probably should) be done at a larger scale and in a more systematic fashion than ever before. In this course, we will discuss the meaning and purpose of scale, as it pertains not only to the number of observations, but also ecological validity and contributing to mechanistic theory building. Throughout the quarter, we will survey prominent "bids for scale" across multiple areas of psychology. We will also discuss principles and best practices for modern psychological science that enable a virtuous cycle between psychological science and other fields, including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and statistical science.

### PSYC 230: Computational Approaches to Visual Abstraction (UC San Diego)
From etchings on cave walls to digital media, the ability to convey abstract information in visual form is fundamental to many human innovations (e.g., painting, cartography, data visualization). This graduate seminar explores the problem of how humans produce and comprehend graphical representations, combining approaches from computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Course participants will discuss both classic and contemporary work in these fields, work with modern computer-vision and human-behavioral datasets, and formulate an original research project to address outstanding questions. Previous experience using the Python programming language for scientific computing and prior coursework in neuroscience/psychology, calculus, and linear algebra is strongly preferred, but not strictly required, provided the student is willing to spend additional time learning foundational concepts on their own.

### PSYC 193L: Science of Learning Data Science (UC San Diego)
This is an advanced seminar and lab course on the science of learning as applied to statistical concepts & data science skills that are commonly used in modern psychological research. This course provides a scaffolded introduction to core statistical concepts and the use of R, a widely used statistical programming language. As part of the lab assignments and final project, you will work in groups to analyze real-world data and communicate your findings using the tools you have learned in the course. You will also have the opportunity to engage with the contemporary research literature on the teaching and learning of statistical reasoning. By taking this course, you are also contributing to improvements in the way that introductory statistics and data science skills are taught in Psychology at UCSD.

### PSYC 193: Perception & Computation (UC San Diego)
This advanced undergraduate seminar explores how people perceive and understand the visual world, combining approaches from computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Students will be introduced to both classic and contemporary work in these fields, and learn to work with modern computer-vision datasets. Prior coursework in statistics, calculus, linear algebra is strongly preferred, as well as prior experience using the Python programming language for scientific computing.
