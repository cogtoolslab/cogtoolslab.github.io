A: Features extracted from drawings and photos using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model optimized to recognize objects in photographs but not drawings. B: Representational similarity across image domains increases by model layer. C: Model classification error decreases across human drawing repetitions.

### Pragmatic inference and visual abstraction enable contextual flexibility during visual communication
