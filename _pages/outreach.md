Here are some organizations that we support and/or lead.

### [Pathways2AI](https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/)
Pathways2AI is an initiative at UC San Diego that aims to broaden participation in artificial intelligence (AI) and promote AI literacy for everyone. We partner with local K-12 schools to inspire students to see how relevant AI is to students' everyday lives, as well as how AI intersects with many other fields, including the arts, humanities, medicine, engineering, & law. This program is generously supported by National Science Foundation Award #2047191. Learn more about Pathways2AI: [https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/](https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/). 

### [Científico Latino](https://www.cientificolatino.com/)
Científico Latino aims to help undergraduate, graduate, and professional students by providing mentorship, open-access resources on scholarships, fellowships and blog posts on professional development. We participate in the Graduate Student Mentorship Initiative. Learn more about Científico Latino: [https://www.cientificolatino.com/](https://www.cientificolatino.com/).

In 2023, we also produced a short video responding to the question, "Can Machines Think?," as part of the CogSci Mind Challenge. You can watch [our submission, "Behind the Scenes," on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amQQ5ADAABk&t=1s).
