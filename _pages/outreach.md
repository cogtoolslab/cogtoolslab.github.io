Here are some organizations we are working with to improve access to education and training opportunities in computational cognitive science. 

### [Pathways2AI](https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/)
Pathways2AI is an initiative at UC San Diego that aims to broaden participation in artificial intelligence (AI) and promote AI literacy for everyone. We partner with local K-12 schools to inspire students to see how relevant AI is to students' everyday lives, as well as how AI intersects with many other fields, including the arts, humanities, medicine, engineering, & law. This program is generously supported by National Science Foundation Award #2047191. Learn more about Pathways2AI: [https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/](https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/). 

### [Científico Latino](https://www.cientificolatino.com/)
Científico Latino aims to help undergraduate, graduate, and professional students by providing mentorship, open-access resources on scholarships, fellowships and blog posts on professional development. We participate in the Graduate Student Mentorship Initiative. Learn more about Científico Latino: [https://www.cientificolatino.com/](https://www.cientificolatino.com/).

### [Black Girls Code](https://www.wearebgc.org/)
Black Girls Code supports girls and women of color through computing education programs, with the goal of helping these individuals access further educational and professional opportunities in the technology sector. In collaboration with BGC and other researchers at Stanford University, we are investigating how the rationale given for investing in coding education varies between contexts.

### [Cognitive Science Society](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-mind-challenge/)
We are enthusiastic about the Cognitive Science Society's Mind Challenge. This initiative challenges cognitive scientists to create a five-minute video addressing a key question within cognitive science but for an audience of non-experts, particularly high school and early college students. In 2023, we produced a short video responding to the question, "Can Machines Think?," as part of that year's Mind Challenge. You can watch [our submission, "Behind the Scenes," on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amQQ5ADAABk&t=1s).
