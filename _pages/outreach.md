### [Pathways2AI](https://pathways2ai.ucsd.edu/)
Pathways2AI is a new initiative at UC San Diego that aims to broaden participation in artificial intelligence (AI) and promote AI literacy for everyone. We partner with local K-12 schools to inspire students to see how relevant AI is to students' everyday lives, as well as how AI intersects with many other fields, including the arts, humanities, medicine, engineering, & law.
