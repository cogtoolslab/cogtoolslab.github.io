The Cognitive Tools Lab is directed by [Prof. Judith Fan](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/jefan.html) and located in the [Stanford Department of Psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu/). The lab also has a presence at UC San Diego, where several lab members are continuing their graduate studies.

Our lab employs converging approaches from cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to reverse engineer the human cognitive toolkit, especially how people use physical representations of thought — such as [sketches](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-023-00212-w) and prototypes — to learn, communicate, and solve problems.
