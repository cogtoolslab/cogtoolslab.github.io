The Cognitive Tools Lab is directed by [Prof. Judith Fan](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/jefan.html) and currently located in the [UC San Diego Department of Psychology](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/). 

**In July 2023, the lab will move to the [Stanford Department of Psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu/). It will also maintain a presence at UC San Diego while several of our lab members continue their graduate studies.**

Our lab employs converging approaches from cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to reverse engineer the human cognitive toolkit, especially how people use physical representations of thought —- such as sketches and prototypes —- to learn, communicate, and solve problems.
