The Cognitive Tools Lab is directed by [Prof. Judith Fan](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/jefan.html) and located in the [UC San Diego Department of Psychology](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/). 

Our research addresses questions at the intersection of computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI. As a case study, our recent work seeks to understand human visual communication. This encompasses behaviors from informal sketching to formal scientific visualization, and its applications to education, user interface design, and assistive technologies.
